Hey guys,I'm Andrei.

Im about to make my first website with the help of The Odin Project
I'll try to apply everything I learned at this point for this project.
I have no idea what I'm about to do but it is title "Odin Recipe".
Today is my 3rd day learning to be a Web Developer.

Thank you if you managed to view this project!
